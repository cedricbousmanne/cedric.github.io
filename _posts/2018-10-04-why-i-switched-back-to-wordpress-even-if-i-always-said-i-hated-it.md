Today on [#indieweb-wordpress](irc://irc.freenode.net/#indieweb-wordpress), [I&rsquo;ve been asked](https://freenode.logbot.info/indieweb-wordpress/20181004#c1750007) why, given my technical background, I did not used some of the [Ruby based solution](https://indieweb.org/Ruby) to jump in and try the [Indieweb principles](https://indieweb.org/principles).

As a reminder, I [(re)discovered Indieweb and POSSE a few days ago](https://cedric.io/2018/09/18/836/) now, and even if I&rsquo;ve been using Ruby and Rails as my main languages for almost a decade now, I choose to setup a new WordPress blog to play around with it.

There are a few reasons for this :

  1. Setting up a WordPress was a one-click task with my current host ([gandi.net](https://www.gandi.net/en), thanks for asking)
  2. I read along the [Indieweb wiki](https://indieweb.org/) for a few days, gathering information about how it is supposed to be done, and [why everyone should have their own website](https://www.onebigfluke.com/2012/07/focusing-on-positives-why-i-have-my-own.html). In the wiki, most of the tutorials were [WordPress](https://indieweb.org/WordPress) based and it seems to me like a good place to start. To be completely honest I did not even noticed there was a Ruby page.
  3. Even if I do not like WordPress, I have to admit that the community around it is huge, thus, more chance to find every plugin I would need to setup [my new home on the Internet](https://cedric.io/indieweb/)
  4. I never said I&rsquo;d stick with WordPress. More likely I am going to play around with it for a few, then find my way back home with a Ruby on Rails solution.
